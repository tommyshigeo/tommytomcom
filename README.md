# ðŸŽ¬ Tom Ryuzaki - Director & Digital Alchemist âœ¨

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm **Tom Ryuzaki**.
You might know me as the guy who accidentally started [TRASHBAG STUDIO](https://trashbag.studio) because the world clearly needed more beautifully broken things.

This website? Yeah, it's where I put my director stuff, my thoughts (the coherent ones, anyway), and maybe a link to my favorite brand of instant noodles.

**Full Disclosure:** My AI buddy, **Gemini**, pretty much held my hand and translated my brain-static into this. I just pointed and said "more glitch!" or "make it look like a cool, moody film poster!" If it looks good, Gemini gets a digital high-five. If it's a bit janky, well, that's just my *auteur* signature, darling. ðŸ˜‰
